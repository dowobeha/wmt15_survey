At WMT 2015, a survey was distributed to attendees.

Two questions were asked:

* Should WMT become a conference?
* If WMT becomes a conference, what should it be called?



This repository contains:

* the survey options (survey-options.tsv)
* the raw tabulated survey results with header data (survey.tsv)
* this data with columns and rows transposed (transposed.tsv)
* the raw tabulated survey results without header data (just-votes.tsv)
* per-option vote totals (just-votes.summary.*.tsv)
* survey results formated for tabulation at http://condorcet.ericgorr.net (results.txt)
* scripts to create the above files (*.sh and *.rb)
* instant runoff voting and condorcet voting tabulated results from http://condorcet.ericgorr.net (results.html)
* a report of survey results, written in LaTeX (survey.tex, which requires pgf-pie.sty)


Many survey respondents did not fully rank all options.
In the results recorded here, any option which was not ranked by the survey respondent is assigned a rank of 99.
